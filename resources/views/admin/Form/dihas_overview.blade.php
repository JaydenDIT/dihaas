                    The objective of the scheme is to grant appointment on
                    compassionate grounds to the next of kin (a dependent family member) of a Government servant
                    who dies in harness leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood. The Scheme is
                    not extendable to generations and should not be considered as hereditary right. In other words, the
                    scheme shall not be admissible/extendable to dependent family member of a Government servant if
                    the Government Servant was appointed under Die-in -harness Scheme (DIH).
